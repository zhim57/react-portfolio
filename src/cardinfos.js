        description: "The weather dashboard is a simple app which integrates the openweather API. the APi can return the current day weather forecast for the given city. Together with that it also returns the longitude and latitude of the city. Another api request can be made using the geo coordinates, and the available responses are for several days, a month etc. This gives a lot of flexibility for the second or thisrd APLI requests. In my case I set it for a five day weather forecast. This feature gives the API posibility to be used in other applications too , for easy conversion of city name to longitude and lattitude coordinates of that sity . We used that in our project 'safe-trails.'"

I tried to solve the problem of enjoying a good burger which most often is conflicting with the healthy way of food combining, ayurvedic food and dosha types etc. At the end decided that it should be a personal choice and let the customers decide what to be the available ingredients and prices. Which luckily coincides with the American spirit of Freedom and independence. Since the 21st century bears the promise of intergalactic travel and possible alien visitors I decided to become a pioneer in the field and introduced the new non-human line of tasty burgers for these future visitors. Which should help my nutritional enterprise corner the market niche of feeding the aliens."
